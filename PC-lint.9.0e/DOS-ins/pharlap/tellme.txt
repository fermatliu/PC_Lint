TELLME is a utility that produces a report describing the system on
which it is run.  TELLME provides information on the CPU, BIOS, DOS,
environment, extended memory, XMS, EMS, VCPI, DPMI, and so on.  The
utility provides a complete picture of a system so that compatibility
problems can be resolved.  TELLME provides the following information
about a system:

o   Type of CPU and numeric coprocessor
o   Information about the DOS version being run
o   Information about the BIOS ROM being used
o   A print out of the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files
o   A list of important environment variables for TNT DOS-Extender
    (PATH, LIBPATH, LIB, INCLUDE etc.)
o   Information about various extended memory allocators (INT 15H, XMS, 
    EMS/VCPI, VDS, and DPMI)
o   Presence of Windows, DESQview, SHARE, and DOS extenders.
o   Statistics about the TNT.EXE file 
o   Conventional memory usage

TELLME runs in real mode. 

For example, if you have two megabytes of memory, yet receive
"insufficient memory" messages from a DOS-Extended application built
with TNT DOS-Extender, you can run TELLME to see what the problem is:

C:\>tellme > tellme.log

TELLME.LOG might, for instance, show that an XMS extended-memory manager
is present, but that no XMS memory is available:

-----XMS-------------------------------------------------------
XMS version.....................................2.0
Driver version..................................2.96
HMA.............................................Present
A20.............................................Off
Size of largest XMS block.......................0K bytes
Total free XMS memory...........................0K bytes

One situation in which this might happen is you are running under
Windows 3 Standard or Real mode, but have not set the "KB Limit" in the
XMS Memory section of an appropriate Windows .PIF (Program Information)
file.  The result is that DOS-extended applications can't get any
extended memory.  In any case, TELLME can tell you what's going on.

If you have isolated a problem to a particular area, you can tell TELLME
to only run certain tests.  For example, the following runs only the XMS
test:

C:\>tellme -xms > tellme.log

A complete list of TELLME switches is provided by running TELLME -HELP.
Rather than run the entire TELLME test suite, selected portions can be
turned on or off.  A complete list of TELLME switches is provided by
running TELLME -HELP or TELLME -?:

C:\>tellme -?
TELLME [switches]
    -CPU                 Perform CPU test
    -BIOS                Perform BIOS test
    -DOS                 Perform DOS test
    -MEM                 Perform conventional memory test
    -CONFIG              Print out CONFIG.SYS
    -AUTOEXEC            Print out AUTOEXEC.BAT
    -ENV                 Print out important environment variables
    -INT15               Perform INT 15 extended memory test
    -XMS                 Perform XMS test
    -EMS or -VCPI        Perform EMS test
    -VDS                 Perform VDS test
    -DPMI                Perform DPMI test
    -FILE                Print out DOS-Extender version information
    -MOUSE               Perform mouse test
    -RUN                 Run the DOS-Extender
Placing a "NO" in front a of switch disables a test.  Example: -NOEMS

If all the TELLME tests run properly, then an application built with TNT
DOS-Extender should also run properly in the same configuration.  This
makes TELLME a useful test of TNT DOS-Extender compatibility.
