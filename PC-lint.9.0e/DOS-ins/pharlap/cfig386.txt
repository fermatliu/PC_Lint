                            Using CFIG386
                            -------------

CFIG386 allows TNT DOS-Extender switches to be configured into a
DOS-extended program.  TNT DOS-Extender switches are described in the
document DOSX.TXT. This document describes how to use CFIG386 to set TNT
DOS-Extender switches so that they are used each time you run a
DOS-extended program.

As an example, if APROGRAM.EXE is a DOS-extended program, and if you
want it to use the -BANNER switch, then type the following DOS command
line (this assumes that both CFIG386.EXE and APROGRAM.EXE are in the
APROGRAM subdirectory):

C:\APROGRAM>cfig386 aprogram.exe -banner

With square brackets such as [this] indicating optional parameters and
angle brackets such as <this> indicating required parameters, the
CFIG386 syntax is this:
    
CFIG386 [-dosxname dosx] [-clear] <exe_file_name> [new_switches]

Note that new switches such as -BANNER come *after* the name of the
DOS-extended program.  CFIG386 switches such as -DOSXNAME or -CLEAR come
before the name of the executable.

The current switches in a program can be displayed by running CFIG386
without any command-line arguments:

C:\APROGRAM>cfig386 aprogram.exe
CFIG386: 8.0 -- Copyright (C) 1986-96 Phar Lap Software, Inc.

Phar Lap program type: TNT DOS-Extender Stub Loader Version 8.0
Program run by this loader: tnt.exe
Configured switch values:
        -banner


Switches can be completely cleared from the program by using the CFIG386
-CLEAR switch:

C:\APROGRAM>cfig386 -clear aprogram.exe 

NOTE!!  If your DOS-extended application was shipped with switches
already configured in, do not use the -CLEAR switch except as instructed
by the application developer.

If you try to run CFIG386 on a program that does not contain a bound-in
DOS extender, you will receive a rather cryptic error message such as:

C:\>cfig386 hello.exe
CFIG386: 8.0 -- Copyright (C) 1986-96 Phar Lap Software, Inc.

CFIG386: Invalid config block signature: 0000 in image #1 of: hello.exe

or:

C:\>cfig386 command.com
CFIG386: 8.0 -- Copyright (C) 1986-96 Phar Lap Software, Inc.

CFIG386: Unknown executable file signature: 2DE9 in program #1 of: command.com

Note that CFIG386 only configures in TNT DOS-Extender switches, that is,
those switches described in DOSX.TXT. Any application-specific switches
are a completely separate issue.


                          Replacing Switches
                          ------------------

Note that CFIG386 does not "understand" TNT switches, and merely places
them into the target executable.  This means that switches are additive;
to replace switches, you must use CFIG386 -CLEAR and then start again.
For example, what happens if you misspell a switch?:

C:\APROGRAM>cfig386 aprogram.exe -barner      ! oops
CFIG386: 8.0 -- Copyright (C) 1986-96 Phar Lap Software, Inc.

Phar Lap program type: TNT DOS-Extender Stub Loader Version 8.0
Program run by this loader: tnt.exe
Configured switch values:
        -banner

C:\APROGRAM>cfig386 aprogram.exe -banner
CFIG386: 8.0 -- Copyright (C) 1986-96 Phar Lap Software, Inc.

Phar Lap program type: TNT DOS-Extender Stub Loader Version 8.0
Program run by this loader: tnt.exe
Configured switch values:
        -barner
        -banner

As you can see, -BANNER did not replace -BARNER. Instead, *both* are now
configured into the file:

If you now tried to use TNT, it would complain about the bogus -BARNER
switch.  You need to use CFIG386 -CLEAR:

C:\>cfig386 -clear aprogram.exe
CFIG386: 8.0 -- Copyright (C) 1986-96 Phar Lap Software, Inc.

Phar Lap program type: TNT DOS-Extender Stub Loader Version 8.0
Program run by this loader: tnt.exe
Configured switch values:  None.

C:\>cfig286 aprogram.exe -banner
CFIG386: 8.0 -- Copyright (C) 1986-96 Phar Lap Software, Inc.

Phar Lap program type: TNT DOS-Extender Stub Loader Version 8.0
Program run by this loader: tnt.exe
Configured switch values:
        -banner

NOTE!!  If your DOS-extended application was shipped with switches
already configured in, do not use the -CLEAR switch except as instructed
by the application developer.
    

                        Other CFIG386 Switches
                        ----------------------

The names of several other switches (-FIRST, -ALL, -LAST, and -IMAGE)
are displayed by the CFIG386 usage message.  These switches are not
needed for configuring bound applications.
